# Schema.org Types — Status & Recommendations (September 2026)

**Schema.org Version:** 29.4 (December 8, 2025)

## Format Preference
Always use **JSON-LD** (`<script type="application/ld+json">`).
Google's documentation explicitly recommends JSON-LD over Microdata and RDFa.

**AI Search Note:** Content with proper schema has ~2.5× higher chance of appearing in AI-generated answers (confirmed by Google and Microsoft, March 2025).

## Restricted — Only for specific site types

| Type | Restriction | Since |
|------|------------|-------|
| FAQPage | Government and healthcare authority sites ONLY (do not recommend for commercial) | August 2023 |

> **May 7, 2026:** FAQ **rich results** stopped appearing across all site types. Even qualifying sites no longer get expandable FAQ SERP rows. FAQPage schema may still help Google/AI systems understand Q&A content and can support AI Overview eligibility, but it must **not** be recommended for commercial sites and must **not** be pitched as a rich-result tactic.
>
> Prefer visible FAQ sections + `Question`/`Answer` (or Article/WebPage speakable blocks) for commercial sites — matching user-facing content only.
